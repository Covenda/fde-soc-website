  "challenge": "A mid-sized fintech company was operating a legacy SIEM with a 95% false positive rate. Their three-person security team spent 80% of their time triaging alerts, leaving little bandwidth for proactive threat hunting or security improvements. They had no automation, inconsistent runbooks, and mounting pressure from auditors to demonstrate detection capabilities.",
  "approach": "We started with a 3-week Assess engagement to document their current detection coverage, identify gaps against MITRE ATT&CK, and prioritize quick wins. Based on the roadmap, we embedded a 2-engineer FDE pod for 10 weeks to:\n\n- Migrate 50+ legacy detection rules to Sigma format\n- Build automated triage workflows using Microsoft Sentinel and Logic Apps\n- Develop 12 custom runbooks for common investigation scenarios\n- Implement evidence collection automation (logs, registry, process trees)\n- Train the internal team on detection engineering best practices",
  "outcome": "After 10 weeks, the SOC was transformed:\n\n- False positive rate dropped from 95% to 15% through improved detection logic and automated enrichment\n- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) decreased by 60% with better log coverage and correlation rules\n- 70% of common investigation steps were automated, freeing analysts for high-value work\n- The internal team could independently maintain and tune detections after knowledge transfer\n\nThe company transitioned to our Operate tier for ongoing monitoring and quarterly detection reviews.",
