  "title": "SaaS Platform: Supply Chain Security",
  "slug": "saas-supply-chain",
  "industry": "Technology",
  "publishedAt": "2024-09-22",
  "challenge": "A fast-growing SaaS platform had no visibility into third-party dependencies across 200+ repositories. They experienced a near-miss when a popular npm package they depended on was compromised, and realized they had no process for continuous vulnerability scanning, policy enforcement, or incident response for supply chain attacks.",
  "approach": "We deployed a 3-engineer FDE pod for 8 weeks focused on supply chain security:\n\n- Implemented GitHub Advanced Security across all repositories\n- Built automated dependency scanning and SBOM generation pipelines\n- Created policy-as-code rules to block high-risk dependencies\n- Developed runbooks for responding to compromised dependencies\n- Integrated alerts into Slack and PagerDuty for real-time response\n- Established quarterly supply chain risk reviews",
  "outcome": "The engagement delivered comprehensive supply chain visibility:\n\n- 200+ repositories now continuously scanned for vulnerabilities\n- Critical vulnerabilities reduced by 85% through automated patching and policy enforcement\n- Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) for supply chain issues dropped from weeks to days\n- Security team gained confidence to respond to the next Log4j-style incident\n\nThe platform now has a mature supply chain security program that scales with their rapid growth.",
