  "title": "Financial Services: Zero Trust Architecture Implementation",
  "slug": "financial-zero-trust",
  "industry": "Financial Services",

  "challenge": "A regional investment firm with $8B in assets under management was running a legacy network architecture with a VPN-based perimeter. After a sophisticated phishing attack compromised an employee's credentials and led to lateral movement across their flat network, regulators mandated a comprehensive security architecture review. The firm needed to implement Zero Trust principles, but faced significant challenges: 120+ legacy applications incompatible with modern authentication, a distributed workforce across 8 offices, tight regulatory compliance requirements (SEC, FINRA), and concerns about disrupting trading operations. Previous attempts by their internal IT team had stalled due to complexity and lack of expertise.",
  "approach": "We deployed a 4-engineer FDE pod for a 16-week phased Zero Trust implementation:\n\nPhase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Foundation & Assessment\n- Mapped all network flows, applications, user personas, and data classifications\n- Identified critical assets and defined protection priorities (trading systems, client data, financial reporting)\n- Assessed 120 applications for identity/authentication compatibility\n- Established Zero Trust maturity baseline using NIST SP 800-207 framework\n- Designed tiered rollout plan to minimize business disruption\n\nPhase 2 (Weeks 5-10): Identity & Access Control\n- Implemented Okta as centralized identity provider with MFA for all users\n- Deployed SAML/OAuth for 80 compatible applications\n- Built custom authentication wrappers for 40 legacy applications that couldn't support modern protocols\n- Implemented privileged access management (PAM) for administrative access\n- Created role-based access control (RBAC) policies with just-in-time access for sensitive systems\n- Deployed device trust with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) integration\n\nPhase 3 (Weeks 11-14): Microsegmentation & Monitoring\n- Implemented network microsegmentation using Illumio to isolate trading systems, client data environments, and corporate networks\n- Deployed Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP) to replace legacy VPN\n- Built continuous monitoring with real-time risk scoring based on user behavior, device posture, and access patterns\n- Integrated security controls with SIEM for unified visibility\n- Created automated response playbooks for anomalous access attempts\n\nPhase 4 (Weeks 15-16): Validation & Handoff\n- Conducted penetration testing to validate segmentation and access controls\n- Ran tabletop exercises simulating credential compromise and lateral movement attempts\n- Trained internal teams on Zero Trust operations and policy management\n- Documented architecture, runbooks, and escalation procedures",
  "outcome": "The firm achieved a mature Zero Trust architecture without disrupting business operations:\n\n- Eliminated lateral movement risk through microsegmentation - subsequent phishing tests showed attackers couldn't move beyond the initial compromised endpoint\n- Reduced privileged access standing permissions by 94% with just-in-time access\n- Improved authentication security: 100% MFA adoption, conditional access policies based on risk\n- Decreased unauthorized access attempts by 78% due to enhanced visibility and automated blocks\n- Cut VPN-related help desk tickets by 85% with seamless SDP access\n- Passed regulatory audit with zero findings - examiners praised the security architecture\n\nSix months post-implementation, the firm successfully defended against a targeted attack. The attacker gained initial access via a compromised vendor, but microsegmentation and access policies prevented any lateral movement. The security team detected and contained the incident within 18 minutes. The CEO stated: 'Zero Trust was a regulatory checkbox that became our competitive advantage. Our clients sleep better knowing their data is protected.'",
