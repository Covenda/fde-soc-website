  "challenge": "A healthcare technology company received multiple HIPAA audit findings related to insufficient logging, no centralized security monitoring, and lack of documented incident response procedures. They faced potential fines and were at risk of losing key healthcare customers if they couldn't demonstrate compliance improvements within 6 months.",
  "approach": "We structured a 12-week Build engagement aligned with their audit remediation timeline:\n\n- Assessed logging coverage across all systems handling PHI (Protected Health Information)\n- Deployed Splunk Cloud with healthcare-specific data models\n- Built 40+ detection rules mapped to HIPAA Security Rule requirements\n- Created incident response runbooks aligned with HIPAA Breach Notification Rule\n- Implemented automated evidence collection for audit trails\n- Trained internal IT staff on maintaining the security monitoring program",
  "outcome": "The company achieved full compliance and exceeded audit requirements:\n\n- 95% logging coverage across all PHI systems (from <30%)\n- Zero audit findings in follow-up HIPAA assessment\n- Documented incident response capability with tested runbooks\n- Automated collection of audit evidence for future compliance reviews\n- Retained all at-risk customer contracts\n\nThe company now maintains an Operate tier relationship for ongoing compliance support and quarterly audits.",
