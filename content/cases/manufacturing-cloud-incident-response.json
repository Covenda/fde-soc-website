  "challenge": "A global manufacturing company with operations across 15 countries had migrated 70% of their infrastructure to AWS and Azure over 18 months. However, their incident response capabilities hadn't evolved. When a cryptomining attack hit their AWS environment, it took 14 hours to detect and 3 days to fully contain. The IR team struggled with ephemeral cloud resources - logs disappeared before they could be collected, and manual forensics was impossible in auto-scaling environments. They had no cloud-specific playbooks, no automated evidence collection, and investigators were still using legacy on-prem tools. The incident cost them $180,000 in compute overages and exposed serious gaps in their security program.",
  "approach": "We embedded a 2-engineer FDE pod for an 8-week cloud IR modernization engagement:\n\nWeeks 1-3 (Cloud Forensics Foundation):\n- Implemented automated evidence collection using AWS Systems Manager and Azure Automation\n- Configured cloud-native logging pipelines to centralized S3/Blob storage with immutability and retention policies\n- Built forensic snapshots automation for EC2/VM instances triggered by security alerts\n- Deployed GuardDuty, Security Hub, and Azure Defender with customized alert routing\n\nWeeks 4-6 (Incident Response Playbooks):\n- Created 8 cloud-specific IR playbooks (cryptomining, credential compromise, data exfiltration, ransomware, misconfigured S3 buckets, IAM privilege escalation)\n- Automated containment actions: isolate instances, revoke IAM credentials, quarantine S3 buckets, block malicious IPs\n- Built investigation workflows that automatically collect: CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, EBS snapshots, memory dumps, network traffic captures\n- Integrated with PagerDuty for on-call escalations and StatusPage for internal communications\n\nWeeks 7-8 (Testing & Training):\n- Ran tabletop exercises for each playbook with the IR team\n- Executed purple team exercises simulating attacks in non-prod environments\n- Documented response procedures and decision trees\n- Trained 12 security engineers on cloud forensics and IR automation",
  "outcome": "The company went from reactive firefighting to proactive readiness:\n\n- Mean Time to Detect for cloud incidents dropped from 14 hours to 8 minutes with automated monitoring\n- Mean Time to Contain decreased from 3 days to 35 minutes with automated containment actions\n- Forensic evidence collection became 100% automated - no more lost logs from terminated instances\n- The IR team successfully responded to 4 incidents in the next 3 months with zero data loss\n- Compute cost anomalies are now detected within 5 minutes, preventing another cryptomining incident that would have cost $220,000\n\nThree months post-engagement, they detected a credential stuffing attack against their Azure environment. The automated playbook isolated the compromised VM, collected forensics, rotated credentials, and alerted the IR team - all within 12 minutes. The CISO commented: 'This would have been a multi-day incident before Covenda. Now it's handled before I finish my coffee.'",
