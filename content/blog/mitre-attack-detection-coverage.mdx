"We need 100% MITRE ATT&CK coverage" is the new "we need zero vulnerabilities." It sounds great in a board presentation, but it's the wrong goal.

Here's why, and what you should measure instead.

## The coverage trap

MITRE ATT&CK has 196 techniques (as of v14). Building a high-fidelity detection for each one would require:

- ~400-600 detection rules (accounting for sub-techniques)
- ~1,000 test cases (true positives and false positives)
- ~50,000 lines of documentation
- Ongoing maintenance as ATT&CK evolves twice a year

And here's the kicker: **most of those techniques don't apply to your environment**.

Are you running ICS/SCADA systems? If not, you don't need detections for Modbus or DNP3 protocols. Do you have iOS devices in your SOC's scope? If not, you can skip 30+ mobile techniques.

## Start with realistic threat scenarios

Instead of treating ATT&CK as a checklist, use it as a framework to map realistic threats:

### Step 1: Identify your adversaries

Who actually targets organizations like yours?

- Ransomware gangs (everyone)
- Nation-state APTs (if you're critical infrastructure, defense, or high-value IP)
- Insiders (financial services, healthcare)
- Opportunistic attackers (exposed infrastructure)

### Step 2: Map their typical kill chains

What techniques do they commonly use?

Example: Ransomware kill chain

```
Initial Access → T1566.001 (Phishing: Attachment)
Execution → T1059.001 (PowerShell)
Persistence → T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys)
Privilege Escalation → T1055 (Process Injection)
Defense Evasion → T1562.001 (Disable AV)
Lateral Movement → T1021.001 (RDP)
Impact → T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact)
```

That's 7 techniques. Build high-fidelity detections for these before worrying about obscure nation-state techniques.

### Step 3: Layer your detections

Don't rely on a single detection per technique. Build multiple layers:

**Example: Detecting T1059.001 (PowerShell abuse)**

- Layer 1: PowerShell with suspicious flags (`-EncodedCommand`, `-NoProfile`)
- Layer 2: PowerShell spawned by unusual parent processes (e.g., Excel, Outlook)
- Layer 3: PowerShell making external network connections
- Layer 4: PowerShell downloading files from internet

Multiple layers = higher chance of detection, even if attacker evades one layer.

## Prioritize "must-detect" techniques

Not all techniques are equally important. Categorize by:

### Critical (must detect)

- Initial Access (phishing, exploit public-facing apps)
- Credential Access (dumping LSASS, password spraying)
- Lateral Movement (RDP, PsExec, WMI)
- Impact (ransomware, data destruction)

These are high-signal, high-impact techniques. False positives are acceptable if it means catching these.

### Important (should detect)

- Execution (suspicious scripting, macro execution)
- Persistence (scheduled tasks, startup items)
- Defense Evasion (clearing logs, disabling AV)

These indicate active compromise. Invest in tuning to reduce false positives.

### Nice-to-have (can wait)

- Discovery (network scans, user enumeration)
- Collection (screen capture, clipboard data)
- Exfiltration (unusual outbound traffic)

These are often noisy and context-dependent. Build detections after covering the critical techniques.

## Measure quality, not just coverage

Instead of "% of ATT&CK techniques covered," track:

### Detection depth

How many layers of detection do you have per critical technique?

- Goal: 3+ layers for critical techniques
- Goal: 2+ layers for important techniques

### True positive rate

What % of your alerts represent real threats?

- Goal: &gt;80% TP rate for critical techniques
- Goal: &gt;50% TP rate for important techniques

### Validation cadence

How often do you test your detections?

- Goal: Red team exercises quarterly
- Goal: Purple team detection validation monthly
- Goal: Continuous testing via attack simulation tools

## Tools for tracking coverage

### Open-source options

- **ATT&CK Navigator**: Visualize your coverage as a heatmap
- **DeTT&CT**: Score detection quality, not just presence
- **Atomic Red Team**: Run real attacks to validate detections

### Commercial options

- **AttackIQ**: Continuous security validation
- **SafeBreach**: Automated breach simulation
- **Cymulate**: Full kill chain simulation

We typically start clients with ATT&CK Navigator + Atomic Red Team (free) before investing in commercial tools.

## Real-world coverage example

Here's what realistic coverage looks like for a mid-sized fintech:

**Total ATT&CK techniques**: 196
**Relevant to environment**: 82 (42%)
**Covered with high-fidelity detections**: 45 (55% of relevant)
**Coverage breakdown**:

- Critical techniques: 28/28 (100%)
- Important techniques: 12/34 (35%)
- Nice-to-have techniques: 5/20 (25%)

This organization has ~23% overall ATT&CK coverage but 100% coverage of techniques that matter. That's a win.

## When "low coverage" is actually fine

Some techniques are better prevented than detected:

- **T1078 (Valid Accounts)**: Use MFA and least privilege instead of trying to detect legitimate-looking logins
- **T1071 (Application Layer Protocol)**: Block C2 domains at the firewall instead of trying to detect beaconing in logs
- **T1027 (Obfuscated Files)**: Use application allowlisting instead of trying to detect every obfuscation technique

Don't build detections just to increase coverage. Focus on techniques where detection is your best defense.

## Conclusion

Aim for 100% coverage of relevant, high-priority techniques—not 100% coverage of ATT&CK. Your analysts will thank you, and you'll actually catch the threats that matter.

Start with threat modeling, prioritize realistically, and measure detection quality over quantity.
